# Portfolio

## Description

This is my coding portfolio that will house all future coding projects. It is currently a work in progress, so I hope you like the temporary '90s look!

This site is currently made by strictly using HTML and CSS. I used the rule of Flexboxes for most items and originally had a Grid for my Work section. I plan to update the the website to a full grid layout in the near future.
